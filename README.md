In Sonobe-Cho, Wakayama-Shi, Wakayama Prefecture in 1998,<br>
there used to be a plan of large-scale construction work<br>
that involves politicians and capitalists.<br>
The president of the neighborhood association of Sonobe-Cho<br>
and the local residents were vocal in their opposition to the plan.<br><br>


Four people, the president of the neighborhood association<br>
and those concerned, who were opposed to the construction<br>
work got involved in the incident and died.<br><br>


The four people died after eating curry.<br><br>

The curry poisoning incident occurred on July 25, 1998,<br> 
at a party held by the neighborhood association of Sonobe-Cho<br>
in Wakayama-Shi, Wakayama Prefecture.<br><br>

A total of sixty-seven (67) casualties,<br> 
including four (4) died and sixty-three (63) injured.<br><br>

The four died people were those who opposed the plan of<br>
the construction work proposed by people with power.<br>
Around 5:50 pm, the party started and the curry was about<br>
to be served to the participants.  It took almost an hour<br>
to serve all the participants.<br><br>

Ambulance cars arrived at 7pm.<br><br>

Police investigation started too early.<br>
・Around 7:30 pm, ambulance cars arrived at a hospital.<br>
・Police investigation started at 7:30 pm, the same time.<br><br>

The police immediately started the investigation with a view to a murder case.<br>
Twelve hours later, an investigative headquarters was set up<br>
at the Wakayama Prefectural Police Headquarters.<br><br>


Prosecutors hid the cause of death.<br><br>

Prosecutors didn’t submit an autopsy report even at the trial,<br> 
and thereby Masumi Hayashi was sentenced to death with the cause of<br>
death of those four people still remained unknown.<br><br>


News at the time reported potassium cyanide was detected in the four dead.<br><br>

News reports changed the cause of death one after another from<br>
the food poisoning to the death by potassium cyanide to the death<br> 
from arsenic, and thereby the death-by-potassium-cyanide hypothesis disappeared.<br><br>    


Death penalty upheld by Supreme Court<br><br>

The person who was identified as the murderer was Masumi Hayashi,<br>
a group leader of the neighborhood association.<br>
She was arrested for murder by putting arsenic in a curry pot.<br>
On May 19, 2009, she was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court<br>
and became a confirmed death row inmate.  She is currently being<br>
held at the Osaka Detention Center.<br><br>


Possibility of false charges<br>
・Cause of death unknown<br>
・No motive for committing the crime<br>
・Nothing to do with insurance purposes<br><br>


 It is highly probable that Wakayama Curry Case is unjust,<br>
 because prosecutors didn’t submit an autopsy report at the trial,<br>
 therefore the cause of death is unknown.<br><br>
