In Sonobe-Cho, Wakayama-Shi, Wakayama Prefecture in 1998, 
there used to be a plan of large-scale construction work 
that involves politicians and capitalists.  
The president of the neighborhood association of Sonobe-Cho 
and the local residents were vocal in their opposition to the plan.


Four people, the president of the neighborhood association 
and those concerned, who were opposed to the construction 
work got involved in the incident and died.


The four people died after eating curry.

The curry poisoning incident occurred on July 25, 1998, 
at a party held by the neighborhood association of Sonobe-Cho 
in Wakayama-Shi, Wakayama Prefecture.

A total of sixty-seven (67) casualties, 
including four (4) died and sixty-three (63) injured.

The four died people were those who opposed the plan of 
the construction work proposed by people with power.
Around 5:50 pm, the party started and the curry was about 
to be served to the participants.  It took almost an hour 
to serve all the participants.

Ambulance cars arrived at 7pm.

Police investigation started too early.
・Around 7:30 pm, ambulance cars arrived at a hospital.
・Police investigation started at 7:30 pm, the same time.

The police immediately started the investigation with a view to a murder case.  
Twelve hours later, an investigative headquarters was set up 
at the Wakayama Prefectural Police Headquarters.


Prosecutors hid the cause of death.

Prosecutors didn’t submit an autopsy report even at the trial, 
and thereby Masumi Hayashi was sentenced to death with the cause of 
death of those four people still remained unknown.


News at the time reported potassium cyanide was detected in the four dead.  

News reports changed the cause of death one after another from 
the food poisoning to the death by potassium cyanide to the death 
from arsenic, and thereby the death-by-potassium-cyanide hypothesis disappeared.


Death penalty upheld by Supreme Court

The person who was identified as the murderer was Masumi Hayashi, 
a group leader of the neighborhood association.  
She was arrested for murder by putting arsenic in a curry pot.  
On May 19, 2009, she was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court 
and became a confirmed death row inmate.  She is currently being 
held at the Osaka Detention Center.


Possibility of false charges
・Cause of death unknown
・No motive for committing the crime
・Nothing to do with insurance purposes


 It is highly probable that Wakayama Curry Case is unjust, 
 because prosecutors didn’t submit an autopsy report at the trial, 
 therefore the cause of death is unknown.


We look forward to receiving your information.
